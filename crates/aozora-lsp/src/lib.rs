//! `aozora-lsp` — Language Server for aozora-flavored-markdown.
//!
//! The server is built on top of the `aozora` library surface from
//! the sibling `aozora` repository. Three primary LSP capabilities:
//!
//! - `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` — every `aozora::Diagnostic`
//!   variant is mapped to an LSP `Diagnostic` with a byte-range span
//!   converted into line/UTF-16-column coordinates.
//! - `textDocument/formatting` — runs the `aozora` `parse ∘ serialize`
//!   round-trip (the same canonical form `aozora-fmt` produces) and
//!   returns a single document-replace `TextEdit`.
//! - `textDocument/hover` — when the cursor sits inside a
//!   `※［＃…］` gaiji reference, resolves via `aozora::encoding::gaiji`
//!   and returns a Markdown explanation.
//!
//! The stable public surface is intentionally tiny: [`Cli`] (so `xtask`
//! can generate the shell completions and man page) and [`run`], the
//! daemon entry point. The internal building blocks the handlers are made
//! of are re-exported behind the `#[doc(hidden)]` `internals` module —
//! for the crate's own tests, benches, examples, and fuzz targets only,
//! with no semver guarantee.
